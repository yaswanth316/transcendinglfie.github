<h1>what is  sorting algorithm </h1>
<B> it is mainly re arranging using the comparison operator </b>
<p> sorting algorithm means re arranging in given array or list
    w.r.t comparison operator  
      this if for the wish that we can take on the things 
      <br>
    <i>the comparison opertor is used to decide and new order of elements
        in the respective data strucutes  </i>
        <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/">refer here</a>
        

</p>
<p><b> there are so many sorting algorithms </b>
<p></p>
    1. <a href:"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/">selection sort</a>
    <p></p>
    <p> !! selection sort is it sorts array in <i>minimum element</i> 
      if we take ascending order.
      This algorithms <i>maintain two sub arrays</i>
      1. subarray which is sorted 
      2. the remaining is unsorted<p></p>
      <b>in every iteration the minimum element is chosen from the unsorted  subarray 
        and the picked and move to sorted sub array. 


      </b>
      <h2><a href:="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/">bubble sort </a></h2>
      <p>
         BUBBLE SORT --> repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order
         . 
         <i>this algorithm is not recommended for large data</i> 
         <b>it has worst time complexity quite high </b>
           
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/"=> insertion sort</a>
    <p>
    </p>
    in this sorting algorithm . it array which virtually splits into a 
    1. sorted and 2. unsupported part  the values from the unsupported part are picked and placed in correct position in the sorted part.
    like we take value and sorted and make them inorder with the sorted part. 
    <p></p><b><u>characteristics of insertion sort</u></b> 
    -> it is simple algorithm with simple implementation 
    --> it is effective for small data values 
--> Adaptive in nature 
--->  it is appopriate for already partially sorted . 

</p> intertion sort take maixmum time to sort it elements are sorted in <i>reverse order</i>
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursive-bubble-sort/">RECURSIVE BUBBLE SORT</a></p>
    <P>bubble sort is simplest algorithm for <i>repeatedly switching</i> the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order </P>
       <p> bubble sort has no performance advantage / implementation . first it send largest element to last and then next second largest-->  second  end position</p>


<h><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursive-bubble-sort/">REVERSED INSERTION SORT</a>
</h>
<p>it as the same as we sort playing cards as in our hands<br>
     it is iterative algorithm as like recursive bubble sort<br>
    this too have no performance/implemetation advantage  as the recursive bubble sort<br>
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/">MERGE SORT ALGORITHM</a><br>
        the merge is based on <b>Divide and conquer</b> <i>paradigm</i><br>
        the array is intially  <b>divided into </b> two equal halves and then they are combined in sorted manner
         <br> finally , when both halves is sorted and then merger operation is process of two smaller sorted arrays and combin them to eventuall make a larger one .
  </p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/">QUICK SORT</a> <br>
     similarly as the quick sort it is also based on divide an conquer . IT picks an element as a pivort and partitions the given around
     the picked pivot. <br>
     there are different version of quicksort that pick pivot in different ways <br>
--> always pick the first element as a pivot<br>
--> always pick the last element as a pivot<br>
--> pick a random element as a pivot<br>
--> pick median as the pivot<br>
<i>the key  process in quick sort is partition ()</i><br>
  the target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an array as the pivot
  ,pout x at it's correct position in sorted array and put all smalled elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x ) after x. 
  All this should done in <b>liner time </b> <br>

  <p><b>Partition Algorithm :</b></p>  <br>
  
  There can be many ways to do partition, following psuedocode adopts the method given in CLRS book. 
  this logic is simple . we start with leftmost element and keeptrack of the index of smaller(or equal to ) elements as i. while traversing , if we find a 
  smallers element, we swap the current element with arr[i]. otherwiuse, we ignore the current element . 
  
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort/">HEAP SORT</a></p><br>
--> heap sort is a compariosn based sorting techinique based on <b>binary heap</b> data structure
it is like <i>selection sort</i> we first find minimum element and place the minimum at thge beginning . and iterating the same process
1. Heap sort is an in-place algorithm (which tranforms input without using any extra memory for its operation )<br>
2. it's typical implementation is not stable , but can be made stable<br>



this is somehthing of making the shorts
3. It can be much slower alt=
